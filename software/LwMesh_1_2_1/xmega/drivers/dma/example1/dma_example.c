/**
 * \mainpage
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This simple example shows how to use the \ref dma_group.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - dma_example.c example application
 * - conf_example.h example configuration
 *
 * \section device_info Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA devices with a DMA controller can be used. This example have
 * been tested with the following setup:
 * - Xplain
 *
 * \section description Description of the example
 *
 * This example will start a DMA transfer between two internal memory areas,
 * and upon completion it will verify this by comparing those areas.
 *
 * During the progress of the application it will output some information to
 * the LEDS, and these LEDS have the following assignment:
 * - LED0: DMA have been started
 * - LED1: DMA completed successfully
 * - LED2: CPU verified DMA transfer to be correct
 * - LED3: CPU verified that source haven't been garbled
 * - LED5: DMA transfer ended in failure
 * - LED6: CPU verification of DMA transfer failed
 * - LED7: CPU verification of source failed
 *
 * In a successful operation LEDS 0, 1, 2 and 3 should light up in sequence,
 * and on fault LEDS 5, 6 and 7 will light up.
 *
 * \section dependencies Dependencies
 * This example depends on the following modules:
 * - \ref dma_group
 * - \ref gpio_group for LED output
 * - \ref pmic_group for interrupt handling
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR. Other compilers
 * may or may not work.
 *
