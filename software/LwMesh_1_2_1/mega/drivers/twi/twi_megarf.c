 * \ingroup group_megarf_drivers_twi
 * \defgroup group_megarf_drivers_twim twi master Driver
 *
 * This driver is the implementation of TWI module of megaRF device as master.
 * Master initiates and terminates a data transmission. The transmission is
 * initiated when the Master issues a START condition on the bus, and it is 
 * terminated when the Master issues a STOP condition. This uses two
 * bi-directional bus lines(PD0 and PD1) one for clock (SCL) and one for 
 * data (SDA)
 *
 * \section megarf_twim_configuration Configuration
 * Configuration is done in the configuration file : conf_twi.h
 *
 * Configuration defines:
 * - \ref SLAVE_BUS_ADDR   : TWI slave bus address
 *
 * - \ref SLAVE_MEM_ADDR_LENGTH : TWI slave memory address length
 *
 * - \ref TWI_SPEED_HZ   : TWI data transfer rate
 *
 * \section megarf_twim_interface Interface
 * The twi module should be configured as master. The SCL period is
 * controlled by settings in the TWI Bit Rate Register (TWBR) and the
 * Prescaler bits in the TWI Status Register (TWSR). Enabling of TWI
 * clock source and interrupt is done by calling the function
 * \code twi_master_setup() \endcode
 *
 * \subsection megarf_twim_usage Usage
 * The include file is needed:
 * \code #include "twi_megarf.h" \endcode
 *
 * TWI transmission is to transmit a START condition. This is done by
 * writing a specific value into TWCR, instructing the TWI hardware to transmit
 * START condition and then transmit the data. Similarly in receive mode
 * This is done by calling:
 * \code twi_master_write() and twi_master_read() \endcode
 *
 * After initiating the transmission or reception the completion status will be
 * indicated to the application code through the following function
 * \code twi_master_get_status() and twi_master_read() \endcode
