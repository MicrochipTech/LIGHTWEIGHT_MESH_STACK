/**
 * \page megarf_twi_quickstart Quick start guide for MEGARF TWI driver
 *
 * This is the quick start guide for the
 *\ref group_megarf_drivers_twi "TWI Driver", with step-by-step instructions on
 * how to configure and use the driver for specific use cases.
 *
 * The section described below can be compiled into e.g. the main application
 * loop or any other function that might use the TWI functionality.
 *
 * \section megarf_twi_quickstart_basic Basic use case of the TWI driver
 * In our basic use case, the TWI driver is used to set up internal
 * communication between TWI modules on the two MEGARF STK600 boards,
 * On one STK600 megarf board TWI is set up in master mode, and 
 * on another STK600 megarf board TWI is set up in slave
 * mode, and these are connected together on the board by placing a connection
 * between SDA/SCL.
 *
 * \section megarf_twi_quickstart_prereq Prerequisites
 * The \ref sysclk_group module is required to enable the clock to the TWI
 * modules. 
 *
 * \section megarf_twi_quickstart_setup Setup
 * When the \ref sysclk_group module has been included, it must be initialized:
 * \code
	sysclk_init();
\endcode
 *
 * \section megarf_twi_quickstart_use_case Use case
 *
 * \subsection megarf_twi_quickstart_use_case_example_code Example code
 *
 * \code

	 #define SLAVE_BUS_ADDR   0xB0

\endcode
 *
 * \subsection megarf_twi_quickstart_use_case_workflow Workflow
 * We first create some definitions. TWI slave, speed, and
 * addresses:
 * \code
	 #define TWI_SPEED_HZ     125000
	 #define SLAVE_BUS_ADDR   0xB0

	 #define PATTERN_TEST_LENGTH     sizeof(test_pattern)
\endcode
 *
 *
 * We create two variables, one which contains data that will be transmitted,
 * and one which will contain the received data:
 * \code
	 const uint8_t test_pattern[] = {
		0x05,
		0x15,
		0x25,
		0x35,
		0x45,
		0x55,
		0x65,
		0x75,
	  };

		uint8_t data_received[PATTERN_TEST_LENGTH] = {0};

\endcode
 *
 * Options for the TWI module initialization procedure are given below:
 * \code
	twi_master_options_t opt = {
		.speed      = TWI_SPEED_HZ,
		.chip  = SLAVE_BUS_ADDR,		
	};
\endcode
 *
 * Set up the interrupt handler:
 * \code
	 ISR(TWI_vect)
	 {
		twi_interrupt_handler();
	 }
\endcode
 *
 * We create a packet for the data that we will be sent to the slave TWI:
 * \code
	twi_package_t packet = {
		.addr[0]         =  slave_mem_addr[0], 
		.addr_length  = (uint8_t)SLAVE_MEM_ADDR_LENGTH, 
		.chip         = SLAVE_BUS_ADDR, 
		.buffer       = (void *)test_pattern, 
		.length       = PATTERN_TEST_LENGTH 
	};
\endcode
 *
 * We enable the clock to the master module, and initialize it with the
 * options we described before:
 * \code
	  sysclk_enable_peripheral_clock(TWI_EXAMPLE);	
		twi_master_init(TWI_EXAMPLE,&opt);
\endcode
 *
 * We do the same for the slave on another board, using the slave portion of 
 * the driver, passing through the twi_slave_init function, its address, 
 * \code
	 sysclk_enable_peripheral_clock(&TWBR);

	 twi_slave_init(SLAVE_BUS_ADDR | TWI_GCE);

\endcode
 *
 * And enable interrupts:
 * \code
	cpu_irq_enable();
\endcode
 *
 * Finally, we write our packet through the master TWI module:
 * \code
	twi_master_write(TWI_EXAMPLE,&packet);
\endcode
 *
 * We wait for the slave to finish receiving:
 * \code
	while (twi_master_write(TWI_EXAMPLE,&packet) != TWI_SUCCESS) {
	}
\endcode
 *
 * We read back the sent data and check whether slave received properly
 * \code
	while (twi_master_read(TWI_EXAMPLE,&packet_received) != TWI_SUCCESS) {
	}
\endcode
 * \note When the master has finished receiving, the 
 *       twi_master_interrupt_handler()
 *       function will copy the received data into our data_received
 *       buffer,which now contains what was sent through.
