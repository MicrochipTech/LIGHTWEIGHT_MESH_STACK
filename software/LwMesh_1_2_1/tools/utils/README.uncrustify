This is a snapshot of the Uncrustify GIT repository from 29. Nov 2011.
This includes the changes commited after version 0.59 that is needed
for the ASF codestyle (Double TAB on continuation).
The .zip files contains the complete code archive, and can be built on
linux with the following commands:

$>./configure
$>make

For windows users there is a precompiled .exe

Any version > 0.59 will supercede the version stored here, as these
changes will be included.
