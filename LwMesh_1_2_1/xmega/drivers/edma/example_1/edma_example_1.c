 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This simple example shows how to use the \ref edma_group.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - edma_example_1.c example application
 * - conf_example.h example configuration
 *
 * \section device_info Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA devices with a EDMA controller can be used. This example have
 * been tested on the following board(s):
 * - XMEGA-E5-XPLAINED
 *
 * \section description Description of the example
 *
 * This example will start a EDMA transfer between two internal memory areas,
 * and upon completion it will verify this by comparing those areas.
 *
 * During the progress of the application it will output some information to
 * the LCD screen, and the number displayed have the following assignment:
 * - <b>0</b>: EDMA have been started
 * - <b>1</b>: EDMA completed successfully
 * - <b>2</b>: CPU verified EDMA transfer to be correct
 * - <b>3</b>: CPU verified that source haven't been garbled
 * - <b>5</b>: EDMA transfer ended in failure
 * - <b>6</b>: CPU verification of EDMA transfer failed
 * - <b>7</b>: CPU verification of source failed
 *
 * In a successful operation <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> should display in
 * sequence, and on fault <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> or <b>7</b> will replace <b>1</b>,
 * <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, respectively within the sequence. Automatically, the
 * example program will give a status, <b>OK</b> or <b>Error</b>.
 *
 * \section dependencies Dependencies
 * This example depends on the following modules:
 * - \ref edma_group
 * - \ref pmic_group for interrupt handling
 * - \ref gfx_mono for display
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR. Other compilers
 * may or may not work.
 *
 * \section contactinfo Contact Information
